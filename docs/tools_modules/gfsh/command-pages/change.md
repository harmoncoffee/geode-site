Changes the logging level on specified members. This command takes effect if the default  logging configuration is used.

When using a custom `Log4J` configuration, this command takes effect only if the member whose logging level you want to change was started using the `--J=-Dgeode.LOG_LEVEL_UPDATE_OCCURS=ALWAYS` system property.

The `change loglevel` command applies only to the members specified, whether they are servers or locators. The change does not apply to unspecified or subsequently-added members.

**Availability:** Online. You must be connected in `gfsh` to a JMX Manager member to use this command.

**Syntax:**

``` pre
change loglevel --log-level=value [--members=value(,value)*] [--groups=value(,value)*]
```
