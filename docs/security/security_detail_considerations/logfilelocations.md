By default, the log files are located in the working directory used when you started the corresponding processes.

For Geode members (locators and cache servers), you can also specify a custom working directory location when you start each process. See [Logging](../managing/logging/logging.html#concept_30DB86B12B454E168B80BB5A71268865) for more details.

The log files are as follows:

-   `locator-name.log`: Contains logging information for the locator process.
-   `server-name.log`: Contains logging information for a cache server process.
-   `gfsh-%u_%g.log`: Contains logging information of an individual `gfsh` environment and session.

    **Note:** By default, `gfsh` session logging is disabled. To enable `gfsh` logging, you must set the Java system property `-Dgfsh.                                 log-level=desired_log_level`. See [Configuring the gfsh Environment](../tools_modules/gfsh/configuring_gfsh.html#concept_3B9C6CE2F64841E98C33D9F6441DF487) for more information.

These log files should be readable and writable *only* by the dedicated user who runs the servers.
