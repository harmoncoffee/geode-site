Geode processes use either UDP or TCP/IP ports to communicate with other processes or clients.

For example:

-   Members can use multicast to communicate with peer members. You specify multicast addresses and multicast ports in your `gemfire.properties` file or as parameters on the command-line when starting the members using `gfsh`.
-   Clients connect to a locator to discover cache servers.
-   JMX clients (such as `gfsh` and JConsole) can connect to JMX Managers and other manageable members on the pre-defined RMI port 1099. You can configure a different port if necessary.
-   Each gateway receiver usually has a port range where it listens for incoming communication.

See [Firewalls and Ports](../configuring/running/firewalls_ports.html#concept_5ED182BDBFFA4FAB89E3B81366EBC58E) for the complete list of ports used by Geode, their default values, and how to configure them if you do not want to use the default value.

Geode does not have any external interfaces or services that need to be enabled or opened.
