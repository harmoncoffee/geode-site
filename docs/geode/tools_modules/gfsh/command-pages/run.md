Execute a set of GFSH commands.

Commands that normally prompt for additional input will instead use default values.

**Availability:** Online or offline.

**Note:**
Some commands specified in the file require online status.

**Syntax:**

``` pre
run --file=value [--quiet(=value)?] [--continue-on-error(=value)?]
```

| Name | Description | Default Value |
|---|---|---|
| `--file` | **Required.** Path to the script file containing `gfsh` commands. Path may be relative or absolute. |  |
| `--quiet` | Controls whether command output is shown. **Note:** All commands run non-interactively when using `run`; this option does not change that behavior. | `false` |
| `--continue-on-error` | Continues executing the script if a command fails. | `false` |
