Pulse provides a variety of different views to help you monitor Geode clusters, members, and regions.

The following sections provide an overview of the main Pulse views:

-   [Cluster View](#topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__section_9794B5754E474E10ABFBCD8B1DA240F8)
-   [Member View](#topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__section_3629814A3DF64D31A190495782DB0DBF)
-   [Region View](#topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__section_D151776BAC8B4704A71F37F8B5CE063D)
-   [Data Browser](#topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__sec_pulsedatabrowser)
-   [Alerts Widget](#topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__section_bfk_sc3_wn)

# <a id="topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__section_9794B5754E474E10ABFBCD8B1DA240F8" class="no-quick-link"></a>Cluster View

The cluster view is a high-level overview of the cluster. It is displayed immediately after you log into Pulse. Information displays around the perimeter of the cluster view show statistics such as memory usage, JVM pauses, and throughput. You can use the cluster view to drill down into details for individual members and regions in the cluster.

Use these basic controls while in Cluster view:

1.  Click Members or Data to display information about Geode members or data regions in the cluster.
2.  Click the display icons to display the Geode members using icon view, block view, or table view. Note that icon view is available only when displaying Members.

    For example, the following shows Geode Members displayed in table view:

    <img src="../../images/member_view_list.png" id="topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__image_npw_sq3_wn" class="image" />
    -   While in block view or table view, click the name of a Geode member to display additional information in the [Member View](#topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__section_3629814A3DF64D31A190495782DB0DBF).
    -   Click Topology, Server Groups, or Redundancy Zones to filter the view based on all members in the topology, configured server groups, or configured redundancy zones.
    The following shows Geode Regions displayed in table view:
    <img src="../../images/pulse-region-detail.png" id="topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__image_glp_1jr_54" class="image" />
    -   While in block view or table view, click the name of a  region to display additional information in the [Region View](#topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__section_D151776BAC8B4704A71F37F8B5CE063D).

3.  While in icon view, click a host machine icon to display the Geode members on that machine.
4.  In the Alerts pane, click the severity tabs to filter the message display by the level of severity.

# <a id="topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__sec_pulsedatabrowser" class="no-quick-link"></a>Data Browser

The Pulse Data Browser enables you to query region data. Note that there are two key attributes available on DistributedSystemMXBean (see [List of Geode JMX MBeans](../../managing/management/list_of_mbeans.html#topic_4BCF867697C3456D96066BAD7F39FC8B)) that you can use to configure limits for the result sets displayed in Data Browser:

-   `QueryResultSetLimit` limits the number of rows that Data Browser queries return. 1000 rows are displayed by default.
-   `QueryCollectionsDepth` limits the number of elements of a collection that Data Browser queries return. This attribute applies to query results contain collections such as Map, List, and so forth. The default value is 100 elements.

See the `org.apache.geode.management.DistributedSystemMXBean` JavaDocs for information on available MBean methods and attributes.

The following shows an example Data Browser view:

<img src="../../images/pulse-data-browser.png" id="topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__image_hhp_dz2_44" class="image imageleft" width="624" />

Use these basic controls while in Data Browser view:

1.  Search for the name of a specific region.
2.  Select one or more regions to display the Geode members that host those regions. The hosting Geode members appear in the Region Members section.
3.  Select one or more members from the Region Members section to restrict query results to those members.
4.  Type in the text of a query to execute. See [Querying](../../developing/querying_basics/chapter_overview.html).
5.  Display a list of previously-executed queries. Double-click on a query from the history list to copy it to the Query Editor, or delete the query from your history.
6.  Execute your query or clear the contents of the Query Editor.
7.  View the current query results.
8.  Export the query results to a text file.
9.  Return to [Cluster View](#topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__section_9794B5754E474E10ABFBCD8B1DA240F8).

# <a id="topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__section_bfk_sc3_wn" class="no-quick-link"></a>Alerts Widget

The Alerts Widget appears in the right portion of the screen and displays a list of alerts.

The alerts displayed for the cluster appear based on the alertLevel field set in the DistributedSystemMXBean. By default, log messages with the level of SEVERE are shown as alerts. You can modify the level by using the `DistributedMXBean.changeAlertLevel` method. See [System Alert Notifications](../../managing/management/notification_federation_and_alerts.html#topic_212EE5A2ABAB4E8E8EF71807C9ECEF1A__section_7463D13112D54406953416356835E290) for more information.

<img src="../../images/pulse_alerts_widget.png" id="topic_F0ECE9E8179541CCA3D6C5F4FBA84404__image_jrc_smt_qn" class="image" />

Use these basic controls in the Alerts Widget:

1.  Select an alert level to view only alerts with a specific severity.
2.  Enter text in the search box to filter the list of alerts.
3.  Select an alert and click Clear to remove it from the alert list.
4.  Click **Clear All** to remove all alerts from the widget.
5.  Double-click an alert to open a pop-up window that displays the full text of the alert message.
6.  Click the check mark in an alert pop-up window to acknowledge the alert. Acknowledged alerts display a check mark in the list of alerts.
7.  Triple-click the alert in the pop-up or in the alert list to select the message text. You can then copy and paste the text into another application.
8.  Click the **X** to close the pop-up alert window.
